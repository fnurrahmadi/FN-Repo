# [AdventureWorks]

This project aims to simulate the ELT process from a single data source to the data lake where the data can then be transformed to create the BI dashboard / reports.

## Tools used:
- Microsoft SQL Server as Data Source
- PostgreSQL on Google Cloud SQL / localhost as Data Lake
- Python
- DBeaver

## Future Works:
- Implement Airflow to automate the process of extract and load
- Create the BI dashboard using the data lake as the source
