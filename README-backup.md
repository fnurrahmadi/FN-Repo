# Data Science Portfolio

My name is Fakhri Nurrahmadi. I am an aspiring Data Scientist. I am currently re-learning topics involving relational databases, statistical analysis tools, data visualizations, machine learning modelling from various sources online and offline. You can find me on:
- [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/fnurrahmadi/)
- [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/hidious)
- [GitHub](https://github.com/fnurrahmadi)
- Or directly email me at fnurrahmadi@gmail.com

This repository is created to store the projects I have completed in hopes of building a solid Data Science portfolio. Each folder in this repository contains a separate project. I am thrilled to continue stacking more projects here as I am driven by my will to learn and improve my skills ðŸ˜Š

# [Projects](https://github.com/fnurrahmadi/data-science-portfolio)

## [Project 1: Telco Customer Churn - Classification](https://github.com/fnurrahmadi/FN-Repo/tree/main/Telco%20Customer%20Churn)
- Predicted customer churn using a hyperparameter-tuned Random Forest Classifier and achieved 82% accuracy and 83% precision
- Performed EDA and treated anomalies based on EDA including data imbalance (SMOTE)
- Selected features based on the rankings generated by Boruta 
- Measured the distance of a customer's data point (tenure and charge per year) to find the maximum discount amount to be given

In the graph above, a line of best fit is plotted based on the overall tenure in years and charges per year. To find the maximum amount that can be given to a customer, we can find the distance between the charges per year of the customer and the charges on the line of best fit at a particular tenure. A positive distance indicates that the maximum amount of discount we can give them. Meanwhile, a negative distance indicates that the customer is not profitable for retention and their value is less than the overall customers.

## [Project 2: House Prices Prediction - Regression](https://github.com/fnurrahmadi/data-science-portfolio/tree/main/House%20Prices%20Prediction)
- Predicted house prices using a regression model and achieved an RMSE score of 0.24951
- Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to find trends and devise a plan for treating anomalies
- Engineered features based on EDA performed and selected important features for the model
- Tuned regression model with Random Search to efficiently get the best model parameters

## [Project 3: Website Redesign - A/B Testing](https://github.com/fnurrahmadi/data-science-portfolio/tree/main/Website%20Redesign%20AB%20Testing)
- Calculated the baseline conversion rate from the control group and the conversion rate of the treatment groups
- Generated bootstrap samples for the visualization of the differences of the conversion rates
- Conducted hypothesis tests and evaluate redesigns based on the p-value and statistical power of the tests
- Determine the best performing website redesign based on the test results
